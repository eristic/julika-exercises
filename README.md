# julika-exercises

## Hi Julika or anyone that found this!

I'm updating this, so stand by for code puzzles to solve as you traverse through HTML then CSS then JavaScript. 

## How do I use this?

You should clone or download the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/eristic/julika-exercises.git
```

And fiddle with the exercises. The examples used here are to get you started with concepts and grasping the untangible craziness that is coding.

## What should I do after I finish all the exercises?

Excellent question. Here's a list of guides that great:
[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Chris Coyer is the bomb-digity. (Level 1)
[Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) - There are some free resources here. I love Lynda and learned most of my advanced coding here. (Level 2)
[Laracasts](https://www.laracasts.com/) - Some free resources here. You can buy Jeffery Way a drink and try it for a month. You won't regret it, if you're into PHP and VueJS. (Level 3)
